LyteBox v4

Since this project hasn't been touch since 2007, I have decided to create an open source project for it so we, the community, can take the initiative on getting the bugs fixed and adding any enhancements. Version 3.22 had a bug in it where it wouldn’t work in IE8, I posted on my blog how to resolve it. Let’s take this project to the next level.
